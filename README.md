# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is 2-fold:
1. The first is for management to understand the number of retiring employees by title.  This will help management see where upcoming gaps will be in their org's talents.
2. The second is for management to determine who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  This will help management understand who they can mentor and grow in their organization as they prepare for the "silver tsunami".

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- The "silver tsunami" will be felt the most for *Senior Engineer* position.  These roles account for 36% (25,916) of the retiring titles.  This is followed closely by *Senior Staff* at 34% (24,926).

- *Manager* roles are the least affected by the "silver tsunami" (only 2 retirees) which makes this position something that perhaps management can consider as outside hires vs putting in mentorship program.

- Compared to the number of eligible retirees (72,458), there is only a handful of employees who are eligible for mentorship (1,549).  Management should consider expanding the criteria of those eligible for mentorship.

- Most employees stay with Pewlett Hackard for long-term as can be seen on the mentorship eligibility analysis wherein employees listed here were hired between 1985 to 2002.  Management should consider promoting junior staff level to the senior positions which (as mentioned in bullet#1) are most affected by the "silver tsunami".


## Summary: 
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - There are 7 distinct roles that need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begin to make an impact.  They are (in order of most number of employees retiring to least): Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer and Manager.  The count per title can be found in my data analysis here: https://github.com/legeren/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/d17bd94d4a7afae8c96d2a4d9a90c014aa9979c4/Analysis%20Projects%20Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis%20Folder/Data/retiring_titles.csv
  
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees (total of 41,380) in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.  Management must act fast before it is the tsunami begins.

Two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami" are:
1. **Breakdown of eligible retirees per department** will help management pinpoint which department they should focus on first
2. **Salaries of employees eligible to participate in mentorship program** should be another focus for management to look at and compare against market to make sure they remain competitive against market and do not lose talent.
